# Eight-Puzzle-Problem-Solver

The code solves eight puzzle problem with A* search using two different heuristics: Number of Misplaced Tiles and Manhattan distance.

In order to run the code, clone the repository and compile all the files using C++ compiler. Once complied, run 'main.exe'. The GUI would ask which heuristic to use for A* search and initial configuration. After providing the necessary information, the code will run until it has solved the problem (that is it has reached the following configuration ) or it has explored all the nodes. 

                _ 1 2
                3 4 5
                6 7 8

If the solution is found, it will prompt the user with the number of moves taken to solve the problem and number of nodes explored.
